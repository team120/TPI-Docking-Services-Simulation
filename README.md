### Trucks' arrival to the port, storage and shipment of grains

This work proposes a dynamic computational simulation to study the behavior
and performance of the activities that make up the critical grain shipment process
from one of Rosario’s ports (city considered to be the most important agro-export
node in the world), through the implementation of measurable indicators for the
different activities in the simulated process to then analyze, through an alternative
model, how a specific change (such as increasing the silos’ unload rate by purchasing
better conveyor belts) can decrease the shipping time of grains and how this change
influences other activities in the process, eliminating bottlenecks and making the
port a more desirable option compared to the competition, justifying whether the
investment necessary to optimize such activities is worth it.
